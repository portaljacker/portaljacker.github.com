It look's like it's time for me to start another blog...again! This timne will be different, I promise!

My goal this time is to honestly just post about anything I damn feel like posting, that will obviously be too long for Twitter.

There will probably be more of a focus on game development related things and video games in general since I'm in my final semester of my Computer Science undergraduate with an option in Computer Games.

I'm sure I'll be posting about lots of random crap, only time will tell.

For now I leave you with this mostly rambling introductory post, which was mostly made for the purposes of testing Octopress.

Look forward to more posts from me soon.

Or don't, you have the right to not care.
