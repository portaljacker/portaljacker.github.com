    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It look&#8217;s like it&#8217;s time for me to start another blog&#8230;again! This timne will be different, I promise!</p>

<p>My goal this time is to honestly just post about anything I damn feel like posting, that will obviously be too long for Twitter.</p>

<p>There will probably be more of a focus on game development related things and video games in general since I&#8217;m in my final semester of my Computer Science undergraduate with an option in Computer Games.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll be posting about lots of random crap, only time will tell.</p>

<p>For now I leave you with this mostly rambling introductory post, which was mostly made for the purposes of testing Octopress.</p>

<p>Look forward to more posts from me soon.</p>

<p>Or don&#8217;t, you have the right to not care.</p>
